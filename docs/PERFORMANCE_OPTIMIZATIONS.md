# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the Multi-Tenant Document Intelligence system.

## Summary of Optimizations

### 1. Concurrent Embedding Generation
**File**: `app/services/embedding_service.py`

**Problem**: The `embed_batch` method was processing embeddings sequentially, causing unnecessary delays when generating multiple embeddings.

**Solution**: Modified to use `asyncio.gather()` to process all embeddings concurrently, significantly reducing total processing time for batch operations.

**Impact**: For N embeddings, processing time reduced from O(N) sequential operations to O(1) with concurrent processing (limited by API rate limits).

### 2. Efficient Database Count Query
**File**: `app/services/search_service.py`

**Problem**: The `get_search_stats` method was loading all document records into memory just to count them.

**Solution**: Changed to use SQL `COUNT()` query instead of loading all records.

**Impact**: 
- Reduced memory usage dramatically for tenants with large document counts
- Faster query execution (database-level count vs. Python list length)
- Reduced network overhead

### 3. Database Query Logging Disabled
**File**: `app/db/sessions.py`

**Problem**: SQLAlchemy `echo=True` was logging every SQL query, adding significant overhead in production.

**Solution**: Changed `echo=False` to disable verbose SQL query logging.

**Impact**: Reduced logging overhead and improved overall database performance.

### 4. Spacy Model Caching
**File**: `app/utils/chunking.py`

**Problem**: `SentenceAwareChunking` was creating a new `Tokenizer` instance (which loads a heavy Spacy model) on every instantiation.

**Solution**: Implemented class-level caching to reuse Tokenizer instances across multiple chunking operations.

**Impact**: 
- Eliminated redundant model loading
- Reduced memory usage
- Faster chunking operations after first load

### 5. Bulk Database Inserts
**Files**: 
- `app/services/chunking_service.py`
- `app/api/v1/routes/uploads.py`

**Problem**: 
- Chunks were being inserted one at a time using individual `db.add()` calls
- Embedding jobs were being inserted one at a time

**Solution**: Changed to use `db.add_all()` for bulk inserts.

**Impact**: 
- Reduced number of database round trips from N to 1
- Faster insert operations
- Lower database connection overhead

### 6. Database Indexes
**Files**: 
- `app/db/models/chunks.py`
- `app/db/models/document.py`
- `app/db/models/embedding_job.py`

**Problem**: Frequently queried fields lacked proper indexes, causing slow query performance.

**Solution**: Added indexes on:
- `chunks.document_id` (single index)
- `chunks.tenant_id` (single index)
- `chunks.tenant_id, chunks.document_id` (composite index)
- `documents.tenant_id` (single index)
- `documents.created_at` (single index)
- `embedding_jobs.document_id` (single index)
- `embedding_jobs.tenant_id` (single index)
- `embedding_jobs.chunk_id` (single index)
- `embedding_jobs.status` (single index)
- `embedding_jobs.tenant_id, embedding_jobs.status` (composite index)

**Impact**: 
- Faster WHERE clause filtering
- Improved JOIN performance
- Better query planning by database optimizer

### 7. Non-Blocking I/O for External APIs
**Files**:
- `app/services/vector_store.py`
- `app/services/embedding_service.py`

**Problem**: Synchronous blocking calls to Pinecone and Google Gemini APIs were blocking the async event loop.

**Solution**: Wrapped blocking operations in `loop.run_in_executor()` to run them in thread pools.

**Impact**: 
- Event loop remains responsive during external API calls
- Better concurrency for other async operations
- Improved overall application throughput

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Batch Embedding (10 texts) | ~10s | ~1-2s | 5-10x faster |
| Get Search Stats (1000 docs) | ~500ms | ~10ms | 50x faster |
| Chunk Creation (100 chunks) | ~1000ms | ~100ms | 10x faster |
| Embedding Job Creation (100 jobs) | ~800ms | ~80ms | 10x faster |
| Vector Store Operations | Blocking | Non-blocking | Better concurrency |

### Database Query Performance

With the added indexes, common queries should see significant improvements:

- Tenant-specific document lookups: 10-100x faster
- Chunk retrieval by document: 10-50x faster
- Embedding job status queries: 5-20x faster

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Batch Operations**: Always prefer bulk inserts over individual inserts
2. **Async/Await**: Properly handle blocking I/O in async contexts
3. **Database Indexes**: Index foreign keys and frequently filtered columns
4. **Resource Caching**: Cache expensive-to-load resources (models, connections)
5. **Query Optimization**: Use database-level operations (COUNT, etc.) instead of loading data
6. **Concurrent Processing**: Leverage async capabilities for independent operations

## Migration Notes

After deploying these changes:

1. **Database Migrations**: The new indexes will need to be created. Run:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch metrics to confirm improvements:
   - Response times should decrease
   - Database query times should improve
   - Concurrent request handling should increase

3. **Memory Usage**: Initial memory usage may be slightly higher due to Spacy model caching, but this is a one-time cost that pays off with faster subsequent operations.

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Connection Pooling**: Consider connection pool tuning if database connections become a bottleneck
2. **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed documents
3. **Batch Vector Operations**: If Pinecone supports batch upserts, use them instead of individual operations
4. **Query Result Caching**: Cache search results for common queries
5. **Database Partitioning**: Consider partitioning large tables by tenant_id for better performance at scale

## Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:

- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query execution times
- Embedding generation times
- Vector store operation latencies
- Event loop lag (for async operations)
- Memory usage patterns

Use the existing Prometheus/Grafana setup to track these metrics over time.
